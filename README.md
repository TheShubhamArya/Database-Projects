# Projects

This has some details about the projects that I made in Fall 2020 at UTA for my Database and File Structures class. This class helped me grasp a solid understanding of the basic concepts, principles, and techniques of data management; an ability to analyze real-world applications, to model data management problems, and to assess different solutions; an ability to use, design, implement, and evaluate data management methods and systems.
I learned database system architecture; file structures for databases; the relational model and algebra; the SQL database language; Entity-Relationship data modeling; functional dependencies and basic normalization.
I have used MySQL to perform the project requirements with the help of MySQL Workbench.
